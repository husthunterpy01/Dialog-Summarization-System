        "response": "Answer:\n\niCloud Drive is an upgrade to Documents & Data, which stores your presentations, spreadsheets, PDFs, images, and other documents in iCloud. It allows your apps to share documents so you can work on the same file across multiple apps. iCloud Drive is available on any iOS 8 or later device and on any Mac with OS X Yosemite v10.10.0 or later. To access iCloud Drive, you must be signed in to iCloud with your Apple ID. Storage limits are subject to your iCloud storage plan. iCloud Drive is automatically turned on for new accounts and users (iOS 8 or later). It stores your photos and videos, documents, music, calendars, contacts, and more, pushing wirelessly to your other iOS devices and computers, keeping everything up to date. To set it up, go to Settings > iCloud and turn on iCloud Drive or Documents & Data.\n\n"
